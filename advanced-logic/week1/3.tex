\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item
This is a proof. The eigenvariable condition of $\exists E^1$ is satisfied because the term $a$ does not occur in the premises of the step, $\{ \exists y \neg Fy, \bot \}$, and in the assumptions the minor premise depends, $\{ \forall x (Fx \land \exists y \neg Fy) \}$

\item 
This is not a proof. The eigenvariable condition of two $\forall I$ steps is unsatisfied because the term $a$ is present in the assumption of the premise of these steps.

\item
This is a proof. The assumptions that the premise of $\forall I$ step depends, $\{ \forall x (Fx \lor Gx), \neg\exists x (Gx \land \neg Hx) \}$, does not include the term $a$, so the eigenvariable condition is satisfied.
