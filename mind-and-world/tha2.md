## Feedback from Quentin Parker Pharr (Mark: 13)

| Section | Mark
| :-: | ---
| [A](#section-a-the-metaphysics-of-gender) | 12.5

In Section A, the author provides general and more specific examples of both internalist and externalist views on gender. They also provide critical feedback for both sets of views. However, the author's understanding of the distinction between them conflates internalism with externalism at one point based on one view alone and demonstrates that they only have a narrow conception of what the sets of views have in common, as the author does not seem to account for biological essentialist views as externalist views.

In Section B, the author provides the basics of Mills's reluctance to accepting eliminativism about race. They more or less adequately capture his charges of such views being metaphysically misguided and politically inexpedient. But, the author does not really provide any suggestions in favor of eliminativism, through the literature that has been assigned. Moreover, they also only provide a cursory discussion of how social constructivism might respond to eliminativism by way of comparing their approaches to race politically.

And lastly, in Section C, the author provides several objections to the Simple Analogy Argument and does a good job of characterizing them and pinpointing what aspects of the argument those objections are targeting. They even provide an interesting possibility for undermining premise four. However, the author does not engage in a substantive dialectic associated with the best objection, as the prompt demands. In this regard, the author does not anticipate any responses from interlocutors holding opposite views and only provides a general summary of why the argument fails.

In the future, the author needs to be more careful in their reading of the prompts and they need to be more focused in their presentation, as even a bit of dialectic for discussions about the best objection would have helped their mark.

## Section A: The Metaphysics of Gender

### Question 1: Internalism and Externalism

> Some approaches to the metaphysics of gender can be thought of as *externalist*, while other approaches can be thought of as *internalist*.
> 1. Give an example of an externalist approach to the metaphyscis of gender, and clearly state what makes this approach an externalist one.
> 2. Give an example of an internalist approach to the metaphyscis of gender, and clearly state what makes this approach an internalist one.
> 3. Indicate which you think is preferable, if any, by pointing out strengths and/or weaknesses in one/both approach(es).

> (Your answer should address all parts of the question, but the parts do not carry specific individual weightings.)

An example of an externalist approach to the metaphysics of gender is social constructionism. Social constructionists think that gender is the product of socialisation. They argue that the concept of women is constructed from past social practices to maintain the social position of people belongs to this gender being exploited by people of another gender, i.e, male. Since women is a socially constructed concept, it's plausible to define it in terms of social factors such as social positions in a hierarchy. This approach is an externalist one because gender is categorised by social factors which are external to individuals. Being all defined by external factors, external perceptions of a person will determine that person's gender. An apparent issue here is that, from the perspective of these external factors, a person is of a certain gender, but this individual can, based on self-identification, claim to be another gender. This introduces internalism.

Internalism considers gender identity as a key concept while also encompassing the ideas of externalism. Mckitrick's approach is an example of internalism. She argues that an individual who tends to act in manners that are commonly associated with women, and is perceived as such by others, is expressing a female gender identity and is therefore considered a woman in that scenario. This approach has both personal and social elements. It concerns internal dispositions which relates to external norms that are associated with certain gender. Internalism does not imply a pure concern for internal factors. This approach is an internalism one because it emphasises the internal dispositions much more than the external social norms.

They both face a serious issue, which is that neither can adequately address the concept of genderqueer. The problem background presupposed by externalists is the binary gender concept of female and male, which is solidified through long-term social practices, so it does not take into account the existence of such a gender in the first place. On the other hand, due to the diversity of genderqueer, it is difficult for externalists to define genderqueer without being undegenerating or overgenerating because there are plenty of ways to practice genderqueer socially. The issue with internalism is similar. It struggles to identify specific norms or behaviours associated with genderqueer and to link them to this gender identity. Neither of them can adequately capture the genderqueer.

Although externalism and internalism do not seem to be the ultimate answer to the metaphysics of gender, they have merits that can be referenced by later theories. Externalism has the feature of ideological resistance. It exposes the socially constructed nature of gender and forms the pushback against the norms and expectations that dictate how a pacticular gender should be understood and performed. On the other hand, Internalism emphasises the significance of an individual's intimate connection to gender categorization, implying that self-identification is crucial in the interpretation of gender.

### Question 2: Genderqueer

> Dembroff argues that genderqueer is a critical gender kind, and as such a form of gender resistance.
>
> 1. Explain what a critical gender kind is according to Dembroff.
> 2. Explain the kind of gender resistance demonstrated by genderqueer individuals.
> 3. Dembroff points to six different kinds of gender resistance practices:  
a. Gender neutral pronouns  
b. Gender non-conforming aesthetics  
c. Gender categorization assertions  
d. Queering personal relationships  
e. Eschewing sexuality binaries  
f. Space switching.  
Pick one of these practices that you think matters especially to destabilizing gender ideology, and justify your answer.

## Section B: The Metaphysics of Race

### Question 3: Social Constructivism

> In *But What Are You Really?* (p48), Charles Mills argues that when we talk about race,
>> ... an objective ontological status is involved which arises out of *intersubjectivity*, and which, though it is not naturally based, is real for all that.
>
> Imagine you are talking to a friend who has no background in philosophy, no knowledge of technical terms, and no familiarity withâ€¯the writings of any theorists on the metaphysics of race. Using your own words, explain as clearly as you can to your friend what Mills is saying about race in this passage. Give them the relevant backgound in the metaphysics of race to understand where Mills is coming from, explain the technical terms (such as 'objective ontological status', 'intersubjectivity', ...), and explain what kind of view Mills is opposed to in this passage.

### Question 4: Eliminativism

> Mills thought that eliminativism about race was metaphysically misguided and politically inexpedient.
>
> 1. Explain what these two charges mean.
> 2. Give what you consider to be a strong argument for eliminativism.
> 3. Consider whether a social constructivist about race might successfully respond to this argument.
>
> (Your answer should address all parts of the question, but the parts do not carry specific individual weightings.)

Eliminativism is the view that race is a concept with no genetic or biological basis, and therefore, the notion of different races should be eliminated from philosophical discussions because it lacks objective grounding. It is misguided metaphysically. Although race is not grounded in biology, it has become a social construct with significant implications for individuals' lives. Eliminativism ignores these implications such as the experience of racialised people and racial oppression. These social realities that have been built around racial categorisations need the concept of race to describe. It is also politically inexpedient. Firstly, the elimination of the concept itself does not entail the elimination of racial injustice. Furthermore, the concept of race might have political significance. If we rashly eliminate this conceptual resource, it is possible that it will be detrimental to our analysis of the injustices surrounding race, thereby hindering our ability to devise policies to address these injustices.

To resist eliminativism even more strongly, we first restate its main arguments.

(P1) If there were races, they would be natural kind.  
(P2) There are no natural kind corresponding to races.  
(C) Therefore, races don't exist.

We can doubt the first premise. They might not be natural kind, but some other kind. Social constructivists think they are instead social kind. Social kind exists because of human social practices, as opposed to natural kinds, which exist independently of human. Social kind reflects the social reality while natural kind reflects the natural reality. Social reality is a concern of both social constructionism and eliminativism. The reason eliminativism proposes the elimination of the concept of race, based on the aforementioned argument, is motivated by the same desire as social constructionism to change the current state of injustice. In achieving this goal, social constructionism can perform better than eliminativism. In social constructionism, they have ameliorative project to redefine concepts like race in order to better align with the pursuit of social justice. By doing so, social constructivists can maintain that race is real in a politically significant sense, but without committing to the idea that race has an essence or reflects natural divisions among humans.

## Section C: The Existence of God

### Question 5: Descartes' Ontological Argument

> Descartes' Ontological Argument for the existence of God can be formulated as follows:
>
> (P1) I have an idea of supremely perfect being, i.e. a being having all perfections.  
(P2) Necessary existence is a perfection.  
(P3) So I know that necessary existence is an attribute of God.  
(C) Therefore, a supremely perfect being (i.e. God) exists.
>
> Now, consider the following objection by St Thomas:
>> Granted that everyone understands that the word "God" means what has been said, i.e. a being than which nothing greater can be thought, it does not therefore follow that everyone understands that what is signified by the name exists in reality, but only that it exists in the apprehension of the intellect. Nor can it be argued that it exists in reality, unless it is conceded that there exists in reality something than which nothing greater can be thought: but this is not conceded by those who hold that God does not exist.  
(Summa theologiÃ¦, Ia, q. 2, a. 1, ad 2).
>
> Your task is to explain in your own words the charge that St Thomas is bringing against Descartes, and explain how Descartes would respond to this objection.

### Question 6: The Simple Analogy Argument

> The Simple Analogy Argument, which is a type of design argument for the existence of God, can be formulated as follows:
>
> (P1) Artifacts, with their means to ends configurations, are the products of (human) design.  
(P2) The works of nature resemble artifacts.  
(P3) Like effects have like causes.  
(C1) Thus the works of nature are probably the products of design.
>
> (P4) The works of nature are much more in number and far greater in complexity.  
(C2) Therefore, the works of nature were probably the products of a grand designer â€“ one much more powerful and intelligent than a human designer.
>
> What do you think is the best objection to this argument? You should justify your answer and make clear which step(s) of the argument your objection is targeting.

We can resist P2 by pointing out the dissimilarity between artifacts and natural objects. Artifacts are intentionally created by human designers with a specific purpose in mind, whereas natural objects are not necessarily the result of intentional design. Natural objects can arise from processes such as evolution by natural selection, which can create complex structures without the guidance of an intelligent agent.

We can also attack the step from C2. While we have empirical evidence of humans designing artifacts, we do not have empirical evidence of a grand designer creating natural objects. Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily supported by empirical observation. Moreover, the step from P4 to C2 seems problematic because the complexity of natural objects does not necessarily imply a designer, just as the reproductive success of a plant or animal does not imply that it was designed to reproduce successfully.

Finally, we can doubt P4. We can argue that the quantity and complexity at the level of natural objects can be designed by humans. Humans have algorithms. Some algorithms can endlessly generate different objects, such as Conway's Game of Life. Some algorithms can generate objects of infinite complexity, such as chaotic algorithms. Although humans currently cannot do things such as designing a new biological species to maintain the food chain, or designing a weather system to stabilize the climate, we have the above examples as evidence, and believe that humans will be able to achieve this level in the future.
