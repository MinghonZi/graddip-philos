The author's responses are somewhat clear and somewhat well-written. The author answers all of the requisite questions, but some more than others, despite having enough words to elaborate and to be more precise in their writing and thinking. The author poses a number of critical points throughout. However, the point made in their Descartes section in response to the second sub-question was not developed enough and relied more on assertion than argument. Similarly, their discussion of Putnam's No Miracle's argument did not present the structure of the argument in a precise fashion, so much as listed the various aspects that Putnam is drawing from. In general, structure is essential in any writing - but especially philosophical writing about arguments. In the future, I hope that the author will use their words to greater effect and that they pay a bit more attention as well to grammar.

## Section A: The Mind-Body Problem I

### Question 1: Substance Dualism

> In the *Meditations* Descartes argues for the view that the mind and body are distinct substances. He starts via establishing the *conceptual independence* of mind and body, via the following argument:
>
> (P1) I cannot be certain that I am material.  
(P2) I can be certain I am Thought (or mental).  
(C) Therefore, the material and Thought are conceptually independent.
>
>Respond to each of the following questions:
> 1. Why does Descartes believe that premises (1) and (2) in the selected argument are true?
> 2. What objections might be raised against Descartes to show that either (1) or (2) in this argument are false?
> 3. Assuming that the mind are body are conceptually independent, why is this often taken to be insufficent to establish the further claim that mind and body have an independent existence?

Descartes argues he cannot be certain that he is material by providing three premises: 1) The senses can be deceived. 2) Dreams are indistinguishable from the real world. 3) There might be some demon control his perception so he cannot even be certain that the material world really exists. Descartes argues he can be certain that he is Thought by providing two premises:  1) Thought is essential of conceiving oneself. 2) Doubts always entail the self-existence even being deceived, dreaming, or being misled.

I disagree with the second premise. The second premise of the second premise, i.e. doubts always entail the self-existence, implies that one can still have self-knowledge even in the extreme situation that one has no knowledge of the outside world. This implies one has epistemic privilege of one's own mind, and this privilege only belongs to oneself, not even by the utmost power such as Evil and God. This is implausible that Evil do not have the power to take over the epistemically privileged access from an individual. It is also implausible that God do not have the power to take over the access for some good reason because God is omnipotence. Thus, even if one has the privilege access of one's own mind, there is the possibility that the access can be taken over by someone or something. Therefore, doubts entail the self-existence is not true in every possible world.

It is insufficient to derive mind and body have an independent existence from mind and body are conceptually independent because two concepts can refer to the same substance. For example, Bruce Wayne and Batman are two concepts, but it turns out that these two concepts refer to the same substance. Descartes filled this gap with two arguments, the conceivability argument and the divisibility argument. The conceivability argument says, if one can clearly and distinctly conceive two things separate from one another, then they are necessarily two distinct things. The divisibility argument claims body is divisible, but mind is not, and one thing cannot have contradictory properties, so they are two different things.

### Question 2: Mind-Body Interaction

> Substance dualism famously runs into problems when attempting to account for the interactions between mind and body. There are three arguments which are often discussed in this context: Margaret Cavendish's spatiality problem, Elisabeth of Bohemia's interaction problem, and Jaegwon Kim's causal overdetermination problem. Which do you think is the most pressing problem for substance dualists? Explain and justify your answer.

## Section B: The Mind-Body Problem II

### Question 3: Functionalism

> Functionalism is a leading physicalist solution to the mind-body problem which states that mental kinds are functional kinds. Respond to each of the following questions:
> 1. What does it mean to say that mental kinds are functional kinds?
> 2. Why do functionalists think this is an attractive view compared to identity theory?
> 3. Functionalism famously faces problems with functional duplicates, involving an **inverted spectrum** or **absent qualia**. In *Troubles for Functionalism* (p.279) Ned Block writes:  
*"Suppose we convert the government of China to functionalism, and we convince its officials that it would enormously enhance their international prestige to realize a human mind for an hour. We provide each of the billion people in China with a specially designed two-way radio that connects them in the appropriate way to other persons and to the artificial body mentioned in the previous example. We replace the little men with a radio transmitter and receiver connected to the input and output neurons. Instead of a bulletin board, we arrange to have letters displayed on a series of satellites placed so that they can be seen from anywhere in China. Surely such a system is not physically impossible. It could be functionally equivalent to you for a short time, say an hour."*  
Do you agree with Block that his **China brain** causes problems for a functionalist view of the mind? Why, or why not?

To say that mental kinds are functional kinds in the context of functionalism means that mental states and processes are defined and identified by their functional roles and relationships within a system. It is the causal role that matter, rather than the internal constitution of mind. Hence, Functionalism provides an explanation for the interaction between the mind and matter while acknowledging the concept of multiple realisability. In contrast to Identity Theory, the Functionalism perspective does not require a one-to-one correspondence between specific mental states and specific physical states in the brain. However, Functionalism's definition of mental kinds is overly simplistic, leading to the problem of functional duplicates. The thought experiment of the China Brain argues that it is possible to construct a system t*hat is functionally identical to a human, yet it is intuitively evident that this system does not possess the same consciousness as the human.

I agree with Block that his China Brain causes problems for a functionalist view of the mind. It highlights the challenge of explaining how functional roles alone can give rise to subjective conscious experiences. However, the China Brain argument doesn't disprove Functionalism. The fact that a theory does not explain a certain part of a phenomenon does not mean that the theory is completely wrong. The thought experiment of the China Brain, rather than causing trouble for functionalists, can be better described as raising a question that needs another theory to address: What is the nature of consciousness?

### Question 4: The Problem of Consciousness

> In *What is it like to be a bat?* Thomas Nagel puts forward a philosophical thought experiment centred around the conscious experience of bats which is thought to demonstrate the limitations of a physicalist theory of the mind. Respond to each of the following questions:
> 1. What is the thought experiment which Nagel articulates, and how does it threaten physicalist views of the mind? (you might wish to refer here to the notion of the explanatory gap).
> 2. How might a physicalist respond to Nagel's argument?
> 3. Do you find this physicalist response convincing? Explain your reasoning.

## Section C: Realism

### Question 5: Idealism

> Consider the following passage from George Berkeley's *Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous in opposition to Sceptics and Atheists* (online edition, originally published 1713): First Dialogue, p25.
>> **Hylas:** Real things, obviously, have a fixed and real nature which remains the same through any changes in our senses or in how our bodies are placed or how they move. Such changes may indeed affect the ideas in our minds, but it would be absurd to think they had the same effect on things existing outside the mind.
>>
>> **Philonous:** How, then, can things that are perpetually fleeting and variable as our ideas are be copies or likenesses of any thing that is fixed and constant? Since all sensible qualities — size, shape, colour, etc. — that is, our ideas, are continually changing with every alteration in the distance, medium, or instruments of sensation, how can any fixed material object be properly represented or depicted by several distinct things ·or ideas·, each of which is so unlike the others? Or if you say that the object resembles just one of our ideas, how can we distinguish that true copy from all the false ones?

> Imagine you are speaking with a friend who has no background in philosophy, no knowledge of technical terms, and no familiarity with philosophical views about perceptual realism. You are explaining to your friend what the above exchange and arguments are about. Write down what you would say to explain them in your own words. Your explanation should make the strengths of the arguments as clear and persuasive as possible; but if you think there are weaknesses in the argument, you should make these clear too. Make sure that your explanation answers the following questions:
> 1. What Hylas' argument intended to show about the nature of the world and our perception of it?
> 2. What Philonous' response and argument intends to show about the nature of the world and our perception of it?

> (Your mark for this question will be determined by the overall quality of your analysis of the passage. Your answer should address these questions, but they do not carry specific individual weightings. You are welcome to refer to other parts of Berkeley's text – I used the online version available here: https://earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/berkeley1713.pdf -- but this is not required, and you can give a good answer referring only to this passage.)

### Question 6: Scientific Realism

> Consider the following passage from Hilary Putnam's, *Mathematics, Matter and Method* (Cambridge: CUP, 1975), regarding scientific realism:
>> The positive argument for realism is that it is the only philosophy that doesn't make the success of science a miracle. That terms in mature scientific theories typically refer (this formulation is due to Richard Boyd), that the theories accepted in a mature science are typically approximately true, that the same term can refer to the same thing even when it occurs in different theories - these statements are viewed by the scientific realist not as necessary truths but as part of the only scientific explanation of the success of science, and hence as part of any adequate scientific description of science and its relations to its objects. (1975: 73)
>
> Your task is to give an account of the argument that Putnam is presenting in this passage, in the following way. First, give a clear statement of what the argument is designed to show, explaining any technical terminology (such as 'realism', as it applies in this context). Second, set out, as clearly as you can, the important steps in the argument. A good answer would also assess what kind of inference Putnam is making in this argument. Your explanation should make the strengths of the argument as clear and persuasive as possible; but if you think there are weaknesses in the argument, you should make these clear too.
>
> (Your mark for this question will be determined by the overall quality of your analysis of the passage. You should answer all of the questions, but they do not carry specific individual weightings. The questions are just to help guide you toward a systematic analysis of the argument.)

Realism is a belief and a claim that reality exists independently of mind. Putnam argument starts from realism and attempts to provide a positive attitude towards the success of science, instead of resorting to unwarranted assumptions such as miracles. This positive attitude is known as scientific realism.

Putnam believes that the success of science can be explained from three perspectives: Firstly, the concepts postulated in scientific theories have real-world counterparts. In other words, when scientists talk about electrons, quarks, or other scientific entities, these terms are not merely concepts; they correspond to something real in the world. Secondly, the theories accepted in a mature science are typically approximately true. This means that while scientific theories may not be perfectly accurate representations of the world, they are generally close enough to the truth to be highly successful in explaining phenomena and making predictions. Thirdly, the semantic of a term is consistent across different scientific theories. For example, the term "electron" in quantum mechanics refers to the same entity as the term "electron" in classical physics, even though quantum mechanics and classical physics are distinct theories.

The most important part of his argument is his final statement. It implies that scientific explanations, while not necessarily true, are sufficiently comprehensive to account for reality. This is essentially a restatement of his second premise, but it is applied from a higher-level perspective to defend that his argument, even if not true, is at least approaching the truth.

His inference is abductive. He provides three possible explanations through limited observations of scientific success. This can be inferred from the use of "typically," "typically," and "can" in his three premises.

A weakness in his argument is that he acknowledges that while science can approach the truth, it cannot guarantee reaching the truth. Critics of scientific realism may contend that the success of science can be explained in a relatively negative attitude, such as instrumentalism, the attitude that scientific theories are merely useful tools for making predictions, without needing to posit the truth of their claims.
