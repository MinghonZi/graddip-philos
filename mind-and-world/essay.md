# Question 6

In natural theology God has been described as having several necessary attributes, including:
- Omnipotence: God's power is unlimited
- Omniscience: God's knowledge is unlimited
- Omnibenevolence: God's goodness is unlimited
- Eternity: God necessarily exists
- Transcendence: God is beyond the universe

Is the concept of God involving these attributes coherent? Defend your answer.

# Feedback from Quentin Parker Pharr (Mark: 10)

This essay is somewhat clear, somewhat well-written, and somewhat well-organized. The author provides a general summary of the various problems that come with God's purported necessary attributes. The author discusses most of these necessary attributes, rather than one or two of them. As a result, the author's discussion is wide-ranging and lacks depth and originality. The author needed to focus on one problem and structure their essay as a dialectic on that problem between various authors that were read. Moreover, the author is drawing on a whole palate of literatures - not explaining any of the terms involved or what is at stake (e.g. A-Theory versus B-Theory, future contingents). The author cannot simply run through these literatures; they must digest them diligently and set them forward on the page with consideration and with an eye to what can and cannot be done in 1500 words. Overall, what the author has attempted is way beyond 1500 words. In the future, they need to consult various philosophy writing resources in order to see how to manage scope and how to approach setting up a dialectic for them to engage in.

## Further correspondence between Quentin and me

Dear Quentin,

I come from a different educational system and have never been exposed to philosophy before. I haven't been trained in philosophical or argumentative essay writing. I am not surprised by the grade you gave me; I had a vague sense that I didn't do well.
> In the future, they need to consult various philosophy writing resources in order to see how to manage scope and how to approach setting up a dialectic for them to engage in.

What writing resources do you recommend?

> In general, structure is essential in any writing - but especially philosophical writing about arguments. In the future, I hope that the author will use their words to greater effect and that they pay a bit more attention as well to grammar.

> In this regard, the author does not anticipate any responses from interlocutors holding opposite views and only provides a general summary of why the argument fails. In the future, the author needs to be more careful in their reading of the prompts and they need to be more focused in their presentation, as even a bit of dialectic for discussions about the best objection would have helped their mark.

I'm having difficulty understanding the advice you gave me in THA1 and THA2, especially the terms
- 'structure'
- 'use their words to greater effect'
- 'responses from interlocutors holding opposite views'
- 'dialectic'
- 'best objection'

In addition, could you provide additional guidance on ways to improve and also some reference materials?

Best,

Minghong

Hey Minghong,

These are normally questions that I would try to address during an office hour within the semester or with a student over email before the semester is essentially finished. But, I appreciate that your educational background is different, and I want you to have the resources you need to succeed. 

Firstly, I would have you look over Jim Pryor's Guidelines for Writing a Philosophy Paper. They can be found online. I was given this template for my philosophy essays whenever I attended NYU and I found it very helpful. But, if you need in person help, I recommend CEED from the university, as they have a number of resources that can help you in terms of general academic writing. 

Secondly, I apologize that my feedback might seem a bit terse - but, I have to mark at a particular pace and might not be able to express everything as concretely as I would like. I often have to summarize what I find from an essay rather than provide particulars for everything. But, if you would like, at the beginning of next semester, I can meet with you and we can go over the feedback so that you can have a better idea of what you need to do in order to improve. This will help you for future philosophy work and, likely, all of your other academic work as well. 

Please feel free to send me an email early in the new semester if you would like to meet.

In the meantime, I wish you rest and enjoyment over the break,  
Quentin

# Incoherence of Divine Attributes

## Introduction

Typically, philosophers agree that the concept of God has the following five divine attributes: 1) Omnipotence, 2) Omniscience, 3) Omnibenevolence, 4) Eternity, 5) Transcendence. However, there are arguments claim that these attributes are incoherent, either there is a logical issue within the attribute itself, or there is an incompatibility between the attributes. In this essay, I take this stance and argue that the concept of God with these five divine attributes is incoherent.

The structure of this essay is organised as follows. In Section 2, I argue that omnipotence is a problematic attribute. In Section 3, I argue that omniscience is also a problematic attribute. In Section 4, I argue that omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence are incompatible with each other predominantly due to the logical problem of evil. In Section 5, I argue that omniscience is incompatible with the first interpretation of eternity, timelessness. To the best of my knowledge, I have not noticed any logical issues with transcendence, therefore, this essay will not discuss it. Finally, Section 6 concludes this essay.

## Omnipotence is problematic

Omnipotence is a self-inconsistent concept. The stone paradox questions whether an omnipotent being could create a stone so heavy that it could not lift it. This suggests a contradiction in the concept of omnipotence: if the being cannot create such a stone, there is something it cannot do; if it can, then it cannot lift the stone, indicating a power limitation. However, this paradox is mainly a challenge for the concept of omnipotence at all times. We can consider creation and lifting as two tasks. At the moment when a being creates a stone that it cannot lift, it loses the attribute of omnipotence. Introducing the order of tasks, and thus time, can work around the stone paradox, but this leads to other inconsistencies. First, it conflicts with God's eternity, as eternity implies that God exists outside of time, so God is not constrained by time. Second, omnipotence is a necessary attribute of God, which should be present in any possible world and is impossible to lose. Therefore, although contingent omnipotence can avoid the stone paradox, it introduces other logical inconsistencies.

Another attempt to avoid the stone paradox is to believe that omnipotence also means being able to do logically impossible things, such as making contradictions true. However, this perspective is fraught with difficulties. It challenges the very foundation of logic and rational thought, as it suggests the possibility of a reality where contradictions are valid. If an omnipotent being can make a 'square circle,' then the structure of math truths becomes arbitrary. Thus, this approach is unacceptable, as abandoning logical possibility would lead to more absurd.

## Omniscience is problematic

Omniscience, which refers to the attribute of having unlimited knowledge, also presents logical challenges. One prominent issue is the conflict between omniscience and free will. If an omniscient being exists, it knows all events of the past, present, and future. The foreknowledge seemingly contradicts the notion of free will: if the future is known and fixed, then human actions are predetermined, negating true freedom of choice.

There are several responses to this challenge. One is the argument that knowing what someone will choose does not negate their freedom to choose. This perspective maintains that foreknowledge does not determine the choice, but merely observes it. However, critics argue that if the future is already known definitively, then it is fixed and unchangeable, which implies predestination and undermines the concept of free will. Another approach is the concept of middle knowledge, which suggests that God knows not only what will happen but also what could happen under any given circumstances. God first understands all necessary truths. Then, through middle knowledge, God knows what creatures would freely do in hypothetical circumstances. Finally, God actualises certain circumstances, foreseeing the outcomes based on his middle knowledge. However, this approach faces epistemic and metaphysic issue.

## Omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence are incompatible

Evil exists. For example, the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 almost wiped out the entire population of the city. Omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence are not logically compatible with the existence of evil. Omnibenevolence implies that God wants to eliminate evil in the world. Since God is omniscience, he knows all the evil. Since God is also omnipotence, he can eliminate all those evil. If God knows all the evil he wants to eliminate and has the competence, then there is no evil in the world, which contradicts the proposition that evil exists. According to reductio ad absurdum, at least one of the assumptions is to be rejected. We do not reject the existence of evil because it is a fact, so one of three divine attributes must be rejected to ensure logical compatibility.

Even without considering the argument of the existence of evil, omnipotence and omnibenevolence are incompatible. If God is omnipotence, then he has the competence to create evil. If a being has the competence to create evil, then there is some possible world where that being creates evil. Thus, there is some possible world where God creates evil. Nonetheless, God is omnibenevolence so there is no possible world where he creates evil, which contradicts the proposition that there is some possible world where he creates evil. One way to resolve the incompatibility is to believe that God can tolerate certain evils, such as enduring short-term pain for long-term happiness. However, since God's goodness is unlimited, He should not be willing to witness short-term pain. Since God's power is unlimited, He can eliminate short-term suffering without sacrificing long-term happiness. Therefore, there is at least no reason for Him to tolerate the type of evil that involves trading short-term suffering for long-term happiness.

## Omniscience and eternity (timelessness) are incompatible

God necessarily exists" can be extended to two interpretations regarding God and time. The first is that God exists outside of time, meaning God is a timeless being. Another interpretation is that God exists within time, but God's time is endless. The first interpretation, timelessness, presents a logical inconsistence with omniscience. The argument begins by assuming God's omniscience and infers that, consequently, God knows all fundamental temporal facts if the A-theory of time is true. However, if God's knowledge of these facts changes, it implies that God himself undergoes change. Since any change in God suggests that God is temporal, the argument concludes that if the A-theory is true, then God must be temporal. For the B-theory of time, the same conclusion can also be deduced. The argument begins by asserting that God is omniscient. From this, it deduces that God must know the current time. Consequently, since God knows the current time, and the concept of time is subject to change, it follows that what God knows also changes. If God's knowledge changes, then God himself undergoes change. Therefore, God is subject to change, so he must exist within the realm of time, leading to the same conclusion that God is temporal. Because timelessness is logical incompatible with omniscience, contemporary philosophers are more inclined to accept the second interpretation of eternality, namely, God is a temporal being.

## Conclusion

In this essay, I have examined the first four divine attributes of God, omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, and eternity, and found several logical inconsistencies within an attribute or among a group of them. The concept of omnipotence is challenged by stone paradox, while omniscience raises issues regarding human free will. The coexistence of omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence faces the logical problem of evil. Additionally, the incompatibility of omniscience with eternity, particularly its timelessness interpretation, implies that God might be a temporal being. These findings suggest that the understanding of God needs a substantial reconsideration of these divine attributes to maintain coherence.
