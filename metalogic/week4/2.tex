\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item
The power set of any finite set is finite. Since the alphabet $A$ is finite, so is the set.

The set is countable since it is finite.

\item
For any finite alphabet, we can construct strings of length 1, 2, 3, and so on. Each length has a finite number of strings, i.e., if $n$ is the number of symbols in $A$, then there are $n^k$ strings of length $k$. That is to say, an enumeration can be specified by first listing all strings of length 1, then all strings of length 2, and so on. Within each length, strings can be ordered lexicographically. Therefore, the set of all finite strings of symbols taken from a finite alphabet is countable.
