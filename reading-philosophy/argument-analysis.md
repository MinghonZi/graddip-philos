## Feedback from Miriam Bowen (Mark: 15)

You've done a really good job of indicating the overall aim of the paper given the many different sub arguments that appear in the paper. There are also often clear explanations in the different subsections. Given the large number of views we're exposed to in the AA it might have been useful structurally in this work to give some indication of the overall aims of the paper at the start so when you're discussing the moving parts in more detail the reader can see why they're all relevant.

A bit more could have been done to indicate the ways in which the different sub arguments you cover all fit in an overall narrative – as it stands the reader has to do some work to see why we're discussing different views and how they come together for the overall argument aim. It would also have been useful to indicate places where Haslanger is making assumptions or claims (i.e things that need to be defended as sub-arguments in the paper).

## Concepts and social practices are intertwined

Premise 1: Concepts do not exist in isolation; they are deeply rooted in social practices.

Take, for instance, the way schools handle 'tardiness'. Schools establish rules and consequences to address and penalise students who are late.

> Maybe just to clarify this point further you could have included a bit more detail on the example as Haslanger gives in the paper (aka tardiness might be stipulated in a strict way or it might be more flexible depending on the social rules of a particular classroom…).

Premise 2: Envolving social practices affect concepts.

We can alter the concepts to fit the needs of social justice. For example, we can alter the meaning of 'gender' to reflect the social arrangements, providing a reference for the legislative body. Sometimes, as certain social practices gradually disappear, the concepts associated with them will also be phased out. For example, 'quadroon', and 'octoroon'.

> Just a point of clarification -- part of her example here is that it's useful to have the concept in order to understand American social history. So there's a distinction to be made about concepts to describe our current situation and concepts to understand our past.

## There is a gap between <mark>manifest concept and operative concept</mark>

> And target concept...

The manifest concept is explicit in the mind of users and is public aware. The operative concept is practiced in a local scope and is implicit.

The author provided two examples to illustrate the antagonistic relationship between manifest concepts and operative concepts: one involving the concept of tardiness in public perception and the concept of teacher practice, and the other concerning the controversy surrounding MIT's definition of incomplete courses. In both examples, the tension between the manifest and operative concepts is evident. While the public holds onto broad, generalised views, those deeply embedded in the specific field have a more nuanced and sometimes contrasting perspective.

## Why genealogy

Traditional approaches, namely, conceptual analyses, descriptive analyses, and ameliorative analyses, can be modified to form different genealogies that are conceptual genealogy, descriptive genealogy, and ameliorative genealogy. The authors view genealogy as a way to study how concepts are embedded in the history of social practices. Among the three new forms of approaches, the author is particularly focused on descriptive genealogy. This is because genealogy brings social context to this approach. The new method that introduces social context coincidentally aligns with the mainstream semantic externalism.

## Externalism can be adopted to genealogical descriptive projects.

Premise 1: Social is an objective type.  
Premise 2: Externalism can be adopted when there are objective types.  
Premise 3: Genealogy introduces social context into descriptive projects.

Objectivity is not only present in the natural world. The author gave an example from mathematics and logic to illustrate this point. A mathematical and logical concept, even if not precisely defined, exists in people's minds in a vague form, such as the limit of a sequence. This indirectly illustrates Premise 1. Premise 2 claims that externalism is appropriate for situations where there are objective types. However, the author does not provide a clear rationale for this claim, leaving it unsupported. It would be beneficial to delve deeper into why externalism is suited for objective realms. Premise 3 has already been explained in the previous section.

## Coincidence of concepts

There are instances where the manifest, operative, and <mark>target concepts align</mark>. This means that what we believe we're discussing, what we're actually discussing, and what we should be discussing are all the same.

> What's a target concept?

## Divergence of concepts

There are times when these concepts do not align. This misalignment can be due to ignorance, ideology, or other factors that obscure our understanding or intentions. <mark>The author has provided multiple examples such as 'tardy', 'evergreen', and 'incomplete' to support this point.</mark>

> Could you go through one to explain how she thinks they come apart.

## Role of social constructionists

Social constructionists are interested in the divergence. While the analyses of constructionists might seem to be changing our understanding, they aim to align our perceptions with what we've been doing or should have been doing. This aligns with the philosophical objective of being aware of and discussing what truly matters.

## Focus on unite the manifest, operative, and target concepts

The author distinguished different projects in the paper. The conceptual project develops the manifest concept, while the descriptive project discloses the operative concept. On the other hand, there are other fields, such as law, that define target concepts, e.g. fairness and justice. These projects are all answering, 'what is X'. This brings unity to these projects. This implies that if one discards the operative concept and target concept, and only focuses on the intuitively fitting manifest concept, it is wrong, because this would result in an incomplete answer.

The author opposes the rigid pursuit of concepts that only fit intuition. The author believes that for purposes such as improving legal systems, we can adjust our existing concepts to serve the purpose, even if the adjusted concepts may not fit intuition. Therefore, the author suggests that philosophers can shift their attention from seeking explanations for concepts that fit intuition and focus more on how the unite the three concepts can influence social practices to achieve the purpose of constructing society.
