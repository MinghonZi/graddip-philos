| **Clarity with which the text is presented (40%):**<br>Has the structure of the text become clear? Have the presenters identified what the paper is aiming to establish, its key claims and the moves made in progressing its argument? | Clear overview of what you'll be covering in the presentation<br><br>Started off with a clear argument overview – I thought it was a really clear way of structuring the presentation to start with the argument and then break down aspects of it. | Might have been nice to either spend a bit more time on this – or revisit it after we've been introduced to some of the concepts in more detail to refresh the structure. |  |  |

## Transcript

Psychological Internalism (PI) is a methodological principle in psychology. It claims that causal explanations in psychology should only invoke internal states of the subject. This principle greatly narrows the focus of psychology, as it eliminates the need to consider factors external to the subject, thereby providing significant convenience for empirical investigation.

Some philosophers criticised this principle. They claim that external factors play an indispensable causal role in the explanations. Putnam and Burge were among the first to propose the philosophical view of content externalism. They argue that the content of mental states is determined by factors external to the subject. This paper primarily focuses on two forms of externalism that have developed from this foundation.

The first form discussed is Williamson's externalism. Williamson claims that it is not the content of mental states, but rather the propositional attitudes, e.g. knowing, remembering, seeing, desiring, and hoping, including their content, play an indispensable causal role in psychological explanations. Williamson proposed the thought experiment of 'Burglar's knowledge' to support his claim: If we want to provide a psychological explanation for a burglar who risks discovery by staying so long in a house, we must refer to his knowledge, for example, that there is a diamond in the house. The presence of diamond in the house is a state of the world external to the burglar. Therefore, it demonstrates that there exist propositional attitudes depend on the state of the external world and have a causal role in psychological explanations.

Clark & Chalmers proposed another form of externalism. They argue that there are mental states, for example, dispositional belief, physically realized beyond biological boundaries play a causal role in psychological explanations. They also presented a thought experiment. Otto is a person with memory impairment who relies on a notebook to record information he needs to remember. When he wants to go to the museum, he checks the notebook, finds out that the museum is on 53rd St, and proceeds in that direction. Before checking his notebook, he has a dispositional belief. After checking, this dispositional belief transforms into an occurrent belief.

Just to clarify, the term dispositional belief refers to a belief that is not currently being considered by the mind but is stored in a memory and will be recalled to conclude in occurrent belief. The term occurrent belief refers to a belief that is currently being considered by the mind.

In this thought experiment, Otto's dispositional belief that the museum is on 53rd St is stored in his notebook. Therefore, the notebook serves as the external realiser of Otto's dispositional belief, with 'external' indicating that it exists beyond Otto's biological boundaries.

Both thought experiments illustrate that there are elements which play a causal role in psychological explanations and exist externally. In Williamson's argument, these are propositional attitudes existing external to the internal states of the subject. In Clark & Chalmers' argument, they are mental states existing external to the subject's biological boundaries. However, what these thought experiments do not address is whether these propositional attitudes or mental states play an indispensable causal role in psychological explanations.

This weakness opens up room for counterarguments from psychological internalists. They argue that the causal roles identified in these thought experiments can be factorised into internal psychological factors and external non-psychological factors. For example, in Williamson's thought experiment, the burglar's knowledge can be factorised into an internal belief that there is a diamond in the house and the external truth of the belief's content or other justification. Similarly, in Clark & Chalmers' thought experiment, Otto's dispositional belief can be factorised into an internal belief that the museum's location is recorded in his notebook and, externally, the notebook's record of the museum being on 53rd St. Clark & Chalmers do not necessarily disagree with this counterargument. However, Williamson rebuts the factorisation approach that knowledge is a prime (namely, unanalysable) mental condition and thus cannot be analysed in this way. Nonetheless, he does not provide a valid argument to support this point.

In summary, both forms of externalism face the same threat. Next, Veronica will discuss another parallel: how they respond to this threat in a similar manner. Following this, Veronica will discuss the significance of these parallels as argued by Drayson. She will also present the first critique of Drayson's argument.

In Week 7, I made an argument about the logical similarities between conspiracy theories and imposter syndrome. However, this week is not the same. Williamson and Clark & Chalmers' externalism are completely logically independent views. Their arguments target different concepts. Williamson focuses on propositional attitudes, while Clark & Chalmers are concerned with mental states. Moreover, their definitions of 'external' are totally different. Williamson defines 'external' as beyond the internal state of the subject, while Clark and Chalmers define it as beyond the biological boundaries. They should not have similarities in reasoning structure, but why did Drayson, counterintuitively, conclude that agreeing with one necessarily means agreeing with the other? Because she introduced a concept to help her reach this conclusion. It is 'Explanatory Generality'.

Suppose Veronica argues smth is a dog, I argue smth is a cat. Drayson would introduce the notion of quadruped and say, we are both arguing smth is quadruped, so there is a similarity between our augments. but it is uninteresting because this observation neither bringing an argument down nor defending an argument; Veronica and me can bypass the notion of quadruped and keep debating smth is dog or cat. Introducing Explanatory Generality to conclude two forms of externalism are similar is like introducing the notion of quadruped to conclude dog and cat arguments are similar. Therefore, the notion of Explanatory Generality is metaphysically uninteresting because we do not need to know this nature of arguments.

More importantly, the notion of Explanatory Generality is epistemologically problematic. We know that classical mechanics can be deduced from relativistic mechanics so we can conclude that the latter has higher Explanatory Generality. But can we deduce psychological internalism from either externalisms or vice versa? If not, can we instead measure the explanatory generality? Explanatory Generality is like Soul. Soul is an appealing concept. With it, we can explain all kinds of phenomena of this world. However, Soul is epistemologically problematic because we do not know who has a soul. Explanatory Generality is also an appealing concept since it is a property shared by many theories. But it is hard to know which theory is more explanatory generalised. Introducing this concept at the first place is problematic, so Drayson's argument is based on an unstable foundation.
