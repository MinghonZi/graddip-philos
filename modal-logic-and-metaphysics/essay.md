## Feedback from Franz Berto (Mark: 15)

The essay presents, discusses and defends the (in)compatibility semantics for negation; it connects to the module topics because in this semantics, negation is taken as a modal: a quantifier over worlds; and also because the second part of the module addressed the workings of nonclassical modal logics, including relevant logics where negation works modally.

A virtue of the essay is that it displays good understanding of the formal machinery it presents, although its exposition is so very closely aligned to the papers it discusses, basically taking an amount of space exactly reproducing the original formalisms, that in a sense it could not have gone wrong anyway.

One side-effect of adhering so closely to the discussed formalism, and summarising in great detail the contents of the discussed papers, is that very little is left for originality: although there is a couple of nice examples here and there, for the most the essay is merely rehearsing the motivations for endorsing the negation-as-(in)compatibility account found in the papers that make for its list of references.

The essay sometimes misconstrues a bit the positions of the views it discusses. E.g. it's not the case that Berto defends the semantics because it grounds a certain logical pluralism; the pluralism follows from the view, as a spin-off, but the defense is based on the fundamentality of the idea of (in)compatibility. And it's false that Berto 2015 and Berto & Restall 2017 "do not ground truth conditions in (in)compatibility. The truth conditions are based on our understanding of the notion of the world, which further defines the algebraic structure of modal logic with partial order. " -- those works do ground negation in (in)compatibility, taken as a primitive. The truth conditions are based exactly on that, not on the nature of the worlds used in the worlds semantic for such negations: different notions of world can be plugged into the semantics, giving different logical behaviour for something that's still recognisably a negation -- because grounded in (in)compatibility.

So while the essay displays good undersanding of its topic, and presents formal ideas quite clearly, and has the right use of resources, it sometimes equivocates on the philosophical bases of the presented views; and lacks critical engagement.

## Correspondence between Franz and Me on Essay Proposal & Plan

Dear Franz,

I plan to complete the final essay focusing on the modality of negation. Currently, I have not completed all the readings listed below, nor do I have an essay plan. I'm not quite sure if I can finish this essay within the deadline if I choose this topic; it seems a rather difficult topic for me.

Bibliography:

- A Modality Called â€˜Negationâ€™
- Negation on the Australian Plan
- Why Must Incompatibility Be Symmetric?
- There is More to Negation than Modality
- Against a Metaphysical Understanding of Rejection

I'm sorry that I should have sent this email last week to inform you of my essay topic. Originally, I wanted to choose hyperintensional distinctions and relevance logic as my topic, but I realised that it would be too difficult to complete in such a short amount of time.

After discussing with Zhao, I found that another possible topic I was prepared for, modal intuition and modal error, is not very related to modal logic and modal metaphysics, and I lack background in epistemology, so I gave up on it as well. This led me to spend extra time searching for a new topic.

Hello Minghong,

So, from the items you have listed, looks like you want to work on negation and modal accounts thereof. Topic is lovely (Iâ€™m a fan) and approved!

I suggest an essay in three parts:

1. A general intro on negation and some controversies concerning its logic and behaviour. It will help you to look and refer to the [SEP entry on negation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/negation/) (Thereâ€™s some pretty technical parts in that entry: donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t get everything!).

2. Then you can track a specific debate on negation and given what you have below, you could introduce the debate between the American and Australian plan on negation.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the American Plan, there is a many-valued logic/semantics with four truth values: true, false, both true and false, neither true nor false. Negation is a tool to flip truth and falsity: when P is true,  ~P is false and vice versa (so when P is both true and false (neither), also ~P is both true and false (neither)).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Australian Plan, there are only two truth values, the usual ones â€“ true and false â€“ but negation works as a modal: ~P is true in a world, iff P is false at all accessible-compatible worlds, where â€˜compatibilityâ€™ is taken as a primitive notion. Thereâ€™s a little debate between me/Greg Restall (on the Australian side) and Hitoshi Omori/Michael De (on the American side).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can look at (i) my paper [*A Modality called â€˜Negationâ€™*](https://doi.org/10.1093/mind/fzv026), (ii) Hitoshi and Michaelâ€™s [*There is More to Negation than Modality*](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10992-017-9427-0), and (iii) the reply to them by Greg and me, [*Negation on the Australian Plan*]().

3. Then in the third part you come up with your original-critical discussion: you discuss pros and cons of the two views (Of course you donâ€™t have to say that the Australian Plan is better because Greg and I are among your teachers ðŸ˜Š you can say whatever you want!). One paper that may help you here is this one, which is not very formal and philosophically very cool: (iv) [*What Would a Phenomenology of Logic Look Like?*](https://doi.org/10.1093/mind/fzaa031) â€“ where the idea is to ground the logical properties of negation in our experience of the world.

I recommend that you read no more than the papers (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) above, plus a quick look at the SEP entry for part (1). Thatâ€™ll be more than enough readings! Itâ€™s a difficult topic but if you succeed in dominating it, it will be an excellent essay and get a very high mark.
